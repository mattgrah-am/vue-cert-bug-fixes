# Bug Found

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, we will do something a little bit different. Some sneaky bugs have made their way into the code. It's up to you to squash them!

## Requirements

- Updating a movie's rating no longer works. Fix it.
- Updating 1 movie's data, updates all of them. Fix it.
- Deleting a movie no longer works. Fix it.

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)
